<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a very enthusiastic Coder who just started coding days ago but i am enjoying this alot than i expected to enjoy and with all the resources i have at my hand i dont
  think there is anything that can take my confidence down now. I did my undergraduate and postgraduate degree which to me are not much of use considering i have not actually built
  skills i need for my growth further.</p>

 <p>About my Projects. I am yet to stylize and post my complete portfolio which i hope and i am confident wouldnt take me more than a few weeks and im read to put in the effort that is needed for one to excel in this field.
   I also plan to complete my masters in the USA and partly learning Fullstack so it helps me when i get there.I am ultimately aiming to be a generalist and take up more than one field because i am pretty sure i know what i speak 
   and i know that everything i do is for a greater tomorrow so i can pat myself on the shoulder that i took this decision of actaully taking up this course even though buying it and leaving it for months.
 </p>  
    <p>All i wanted to do before was to play aorund but now i know what i want in life and i am perfectly clear and have confidence in me that i am capable of doing anything. I Believe this course would help me through this journey.</p>
