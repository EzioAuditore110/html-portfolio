<h1>My top 2 best anime:</h1>
<hr />

<ol>
    <li>1.Naruto:</li>
    <p> I love this anime because it tells us many life lessons which normally we dont see happening with other movies or cartoons. This anime holds the emotions of an outcast turning itno the hero of their village</p>
    <li>2.One piece:</li>
    <p>This anime is well renowned as the top anime airing for quite some time sicne naruto has ended. I love the main character Luffy and way of approach to any obstacle. He also inspires everyone around him while also managing to be goofy sometimes</p>
